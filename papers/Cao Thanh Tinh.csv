The obtained results show that the optimal values of a convex quadratic semi-infinite problem with convex compact sets and its associated conic linear programming dual problem are equal with the solution attainment of the dual program. We then prove that the conic linear programming dual is equivalently reformulated as a second-order cone programming problem whenever the index sets are ellipsoids, balls, cross-polytopes or boxes. As an application, we show that a class of separable fractional quadratic semi-infinite programs also admits second-order cone programming duality under ellipsoidal index sets."

It can be seen from [18]-[22],[23],[28]-[29],[38]-[39] that the theory of FDEs with infinite delay was initially studied in the 1970s, 1980s. A complete theory of FDEs with infinite delay is mentioned in [19]. Their practical applications broadly exist in many applications, such as …"

The aim of the paper is to study the solvability and stability of SSDEs with delay. It is difficult to investigate these properties for SSDEs with a delay because of the singularity of the leading coefficient matrix. An index-ν concept is derived for the solvability of these equations. Stability of SSDEs with delay is studied by using the method of Lyapunov functions and comparison principle. An example is given to illustrate the results. To the best of our knowledge, these results are novel for SSDEs with delay."
